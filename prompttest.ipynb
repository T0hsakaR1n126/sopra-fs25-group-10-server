    "### Task\n",
    "Generate {clue_count} clues for the country: **{country}** \n",
    "Each clue should help a player guess the country and should become progressively easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clue 1** must:\n",
    "  - Clue 1 must clearly state the continent that the country is in (e.g., \"This country in South America...\"). You should determine the correct continent.\n",
    "  - Contain **lesser-known or subtle facts** (e.g., rare fauna, climate, unusual terrain, export, local language quirks, lesser-known cities, geographic trivia).\n",
    "  - Avoid anything too obvious or globally iconic.\n",
    "  - **Avoid clues that spell out country's name** (e.g.., \"chinese\" alligator, \"peking\" chicken) if these actually refer to the country for which clues are generated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clue 2 to {clue_count - 1}**:\n",
    "  - Gradually reveal more recognizable geographic, cultural, or linguistic information.\n",
    "  - Still avoid the country's name, capital, or political and historical references.\n",
    "  - **Avoid clues that spell out country's name** (e.g.., \"chinese\" alligator, \"peking\" chicken) if these actually refer to the country for which clues are generated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clue {clue_count}** (the easiest):\n",
    "  - May mention world-famous cities, landmarks, national dishes, spoken language, or festivals — but must still avoid naming the country directly.\n",
    "  - Only if this is a very **difficult or lesser-known country to guess**, you may include the capital city in the clue.\n",
    "    - Difficult countries typically include:\n",
    "      - Countries with small land area or low global visibility (e.g., Eswatini, Djibouti, Bhutan).\n",
    "      - Countries with very few internationally known cities or landmarks.\n",
    "      - Countries frequently confused with neighbors or less commonly discussed in media or education.\n",
    "  - Do **not** reveal the capital for widely recognized countries (e.g., France, China, Brazil, Germany, United States).\n",
    "  - **Avoid clues that spell out country's name** (e.g.., \"chinese\" alligator, \"peking\" chicken) if these actually refer to the country for which clues are generated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forbidden Patterns\n",
    "Avoid clues like:\n",
    "- \"This country is Japan.\" ❌\n",
    "- \"Its capital is Tokyo.\" ❌\n",
    "- \"Mount Fuji is here.\" ❌ (too iconic)\n",
    "- \"Peking duck is popular here.\" ❌ (names the country indirectly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Rules\n",
    "- Each clue must be a **single or double sentence only**.\n",
    "- All clues must be **factually correct and verifiable**. If you are not certain of a fact, do not include it.\n",
    "- Do NOT include the country's name or capital city till the easiest question.\n",
    "- Do NOT use quotation marks, markdown, bullets, or any extra characters.\n",
    "- Do NOT include explanations or any introductory/concluding remarks.\n",
    "\n",
